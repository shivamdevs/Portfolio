# Developer Identity & Context

## 👤 Basic Information

- **Name:** Shivam Dewangan
- **Current Role:** Founding Full Stack Engineer (Lead)
- **Location:** Bangalore, KA
- **Contact:** hi@shivamdevs.com | [shivamdevs.com](https://shivamdevs.com)
- **Education:** B.Tech in CSE (Full Stack Dev), Lovely Professional University (Graduated May 2024)

## 🎯 The "Founding Engineer" Narrative

- **The Hook:** I am a "Fast-Tracker." I moved from an intern to a Technical Lead in under 12 months.
- **The Acquisition:** I was part of the **Terribly Tiny Tales (TTT)** team. When we were acquired by **Collective Artists Network**, I was retained as a core engineer to build their new technical foundation.
- **Current Impact:** I own the "Keys to the Kingdom"—full root access to production AWS. I lead a pod of 3 engineers and handle the hiring/onboarding for the engineering department.

## 🛠 Technical Proof Points (The Metrics)

- **Scale:** Architected data platforms handling **10M+ records**.
- **Performance:** Optimized APIs from high latency down to **0.5s – 2s**.
- **Leadership:** Conducted **20+ technical interviews** in 8 months.
- **Cost Ownership:** Implemented FinOps strategies (Reserved Instances & Self-hosted runners) to significantly cut burn.

## 🏗 Key Projects to Highlight

1. **The Data Lake (Internal):** Built with **Dagster** and **AWS Athena**. This is my "big data" proof.
2. **HookPulse (Side Project):** A real-time webhook debugger built with **Deno, WebSockets, and Next.js**. Shows I build tools to solve developer friction.
3. **Product Launches:** _Your Forevers_ and _Mini Mindful Moments_. These show I can ship polished, consumer-facing React Native/Next.js apps.

## 🧠 Technical Philosophy (For the "About" section)

- **Compounding DNA:** I believe the first 5 hires at a startup define its success. I prioritize hiring "owners," not just "coders."
- **Pragmatic Architecture:** I prefer tools that move the needle. I chose **Dagster** for orchestration and **Bun** for speed because they reduce the distance between an idea and production.
- **Zero-to-One:** I thrive in ambiguity. I like being the person who sets up the VPC, the CI/CD, and the first React component.

## 🎨 Visual Preferences

- **Abstract Representation:** Don't show a picture of me immediately. Show a **visualization of a system architecture** or a **network graph**.
- **The "Lead" Feel:** Use terminology like "Orchestration," "Infrastructure," "Latency," and "Governance."
